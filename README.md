# What is TUMA
Tuma is a language designed to have the worst possible User Experience

## Syntax
You can run one instruction per line
### Right now there are:
```
END -> Just ends the Programm
JMP num -> Jumps to line num
OUT String -> Note there are no quotes! U can use {var} to insert a variable. It is just an output to the Console.
IN varname -> Creates an variable and sets its value to an input out of the next line
VAl name value -> Creates an variable and sets the value. Infers the type.
You can also do VAL x (2 + 1) to evaluate an expression.
COND (true) x -> If the condition is true it jumps to line x.
```
